ABOUT OUR SERVICES:

We always use a woofer for all services, so you do not risk being banned for our camo/skin services and lobbies.
SERVER DISCONNECTIONS:

A server disconnection can lead to a temporary ban (shadow ban) of 2 weeks. This most often happens to low-level, unverified accounts, or after being reported multiple times.
TEMPORARY BAN (SHADOW BAN):

If you notice unusual spikes in your ping (e.g., from 90ms to 200ms...), can't find matches, or only end up in temporary ban (shadowban) lobbies, it means the anti-cheat has placed your account under review to determine if you are cheating or not, for a specific duration (usually 14 days). If this happens, play on a new account until the original is unbanned.
PERMANENT BAN (HWID):

If you can no longer launch your game and a ban message appears on your launcher, it means you have been permanently banned from the game. In this case, there is nothing else to do but play on another account.

If you wish to play again despite a permanent ban, you will need to use a sp00fer / w00fer to avoid being automatically banned.

USE A SP00FER & BLOCKER!

By using a SP00FER, you cannot be banned for HWID (components).
By using a BLOCKER, you block the main features of the anti-cheat, significantly reducing the risk of being banned.
By using a W00FER, you will be sp00fed and also benefit from the advantages of the blocker. (woofer = sp00fer + blocker)
AGED ACCOUNTS:

Recent accounts (level 1-50) are riskier to use than high-level aged accounts. The lower your Activision account level, the higher the risk of temporary (shadowban) and permanent bans. It is always better to buy high-quality aged accounts.
